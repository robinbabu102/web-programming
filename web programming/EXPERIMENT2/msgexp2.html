<b>Dear Students, Staffs and Parents</b>,<br><br>

Welcome to <u>College of Engineering Vadakara(CEV)</u>. CEV is a government controlled institution of 
academic excellence established in 1999. At CEV,<br> we are imparting technical education to young students.
 Technical Education is the backbone of the nation and stepping stone for a country to emerge into the status 
of a developed nation.<br>The focus of the Institution is to empower students with sound knowledge and skill
 to make them creators and fit for highly competitive global industrial market. We have well equipped labs,<br>
 workshops and libraries to help the students in attaining highest standards in academics, research and professional skills. We believe in providing a supportive environment to our students according to their interests. The campus has adequate sports facilities to take care of sports and recreational activities. The societies like <i>IEEE, CSI, EDC </i>works as strong platform for the improvement of their skills. The infrastructure facilities combined with a group of competent and dedicated faculty contribute to the outcome based teaching learning process. I strongly believe that- “All challenges of life can be overcome with strong determination and hard work”. I wish the best for all our students, and the members of the institution in achieving excellence in academic and extra-curricular fields.
